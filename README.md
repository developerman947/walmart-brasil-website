# Walmart Brasil Website

Welcome to the Walmart Brasil Website project! This is a simple web application that showcases a variety of products available in a typical online shopping experience. The project is built using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend API.

## Project Overview

The Walmart Brasil Website allows users to view products and their details. The application fetches product information from a local API and displays it on the homepage. Each product is presented in a card format, enhancing the user experience and making it easy to browse.

## Installation

To get started with the Walmart Brasil Website, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/walmart-website.git
   cd walmart-website
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

   - Navigate to the frontend directory (if separated) and install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up the data:**
   - Make sure you have a `products.json` file in the `data` directory with the product details.

4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run your frontend application:**
   If you have set up a frontend folder separately, start the frontend server. Otherwise, continue with the backend if the React setup is within the same project.

## Usage

Once the services are running:

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (default backend port).
- Browse the products displayed on the homepage and click on any product card to view its details.

## Features

- **Product Display:** The application lists products fetched from a local API.
- **Product Detail View:** Clicking on a product card navigates to a detail view of the product.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI adapts to various screen sizes for better accessibility.

## Dependencies

The project has the following main dependencies:

- **express**: A web framework for Node.js to create the server.
- **cors**: A package to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

To install dependencies, ensure that you run `npm install` in the respective directories as mentioned in the installation section.

Here are the dependencies listed in `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2",
